## ![Meowtar The Blue](Siomeow%20Legends/Assets/GIFs/Meowtar_The_Blue_Idle.gif) Introduction

What if the moon was not just a moon, but a being bound by duty‚Äîone moon, carrying the weight every night? There was never an enemy, only two souls who found in each other what they had longed for‚Äîa friend. Yet, the moon must shine for the people, while the Bakunawa, drawn to him, unknowingly brings harm each time it rises from the sea to take the moon away. Separated by fate, they exist in different worlds. Will they always yearn for each other, forever admiring from afar?

Tinguha sa Bulan, depending on the English translation, carries two meanings‚ÄîDesire of the Moon and Desire for the Moon. In this retelling, why not both?

* Desire of the Moon: The moon longs to be with its dear friend, the Bakunawa, to escape the burden of being the light for everyone.

* Desire for the Moon: The Bakunawa yearns for the day the moon can join it in the depths, away from duty, simply to be together again.

They do not seek to harm, only to be with one another. They just wanted each other to be happy.

**Tinguha sa Bulan** is a short AR (Augmented Reality) game that reimagines the traditional Visayan legend of the Bakunawa and the Seven Moons. This project explores how technology‚Äîspecifically AR‚Äîcan serve as a bridge between oral tradition and modern digital storytelling.

The game mixes 2D pixel art and real-world interaction, where players engage with objects around them to piece together the narrative and relive the longing between the moon and the Bakunawa.
